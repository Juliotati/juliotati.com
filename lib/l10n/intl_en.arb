  "longBio": "I’m someone who embraces change, advocates for the long term, loves to have things in order but when things are not in order, I devote myself into ferociously (with care), cleaning up before proceeding, and I’m proactively learning and refining skills.\nSolving problems and learning how to learn is one of the things I appreciate and value the most.\n\nFrom a very young age I have always been driven by self-motivation and work ethic beyond what people would expect, and this to me has become an embedded habit/behavior when I want, have, or need to get something done, which has always set me apart from many in the eyes of those that have watched me.",
